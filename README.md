In order to test and forecast photos, we have implemented TensorFlow here. The model has been tested and predicted with the use of an Intel image classification dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification), and we are demonstrating the classwise correctness of the model by demonstrating that classes are existent in the dataset.
